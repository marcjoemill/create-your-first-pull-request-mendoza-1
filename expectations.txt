CMSC 100 U3L

First and foremost, I hope that through CMSC 100, I can fully master the use of Git and GitHub. 
I also expect to learn many skills related to web development. 
Right now, I only have little experience on frontend development. 
However, I hope that I can fully master full stack development by the end of this semester.
